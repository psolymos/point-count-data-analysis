# Day 0: Getting ready

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of statistical, mathematical and physical concepts.
Specifically, generalised linear regression models, including mixed models; 
basic knowledge of calculus.

Familiarity with R, ability to import/export data, manipulate data frames, fit basic statistical
models (up to GLM) and generate simple exploratory and diagnostic plots.
