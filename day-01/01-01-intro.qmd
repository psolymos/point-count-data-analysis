## What you will learn

- Understand basic statistical concepts related to detection error
- Work with field collected data and data from automated recording units (ARU)
- Know packages such as unmarked, detect, bSims
- Critically evaluate modelling options and assumptions using simulations
- Fit N-mixture, distance sampling, and time-removal models to data

## In short

1. How to analyze your point count data when
2. How to violate assumptions and get away with it

# Prerequisites

A basic understanding of statistical, mathematical and physical concepts.
Specifically, generalised linear regression models, including mixed models; 
basic knowledge of calculus.

Familiarity with R, ability to import/export data, manipulate data frames, fit basic statistical
models (up to GLM) and generate simple exploratory and diagnostic plots.

See Day 0 on GitHub: links to free resources.

## Setup instructions

- Install R
- Install RStudio/VS Code/Positron/Emacs, etc.

Install required packages with the
`install.R` script:

```R
source(paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/",
    "psolymos/point-count-data-analysis/refs/heads/main/day-00/install.R"))
```

See Day 0 on GitHub.
